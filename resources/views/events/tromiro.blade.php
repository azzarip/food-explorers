            <p>Close your eyes and imagine yourself wandering the cobbled streets of <strong>old Napoli</strong>.</p>
            <p>The air is alive with the <strong>wood-fired perfume of bubbling dough, roasted San Marzano tomatoes, and
                    fresh basil</strong> picked just moments ago.</p>
            <p>On <strong>Thursday 29. March</strong>, for one night only, Z√ºrich will become your gateway <strong>to
                    Naples</strong> as we host a magical evening of pizza, passion, and southern Italian soul.</p>

            <p class="text-2xl text-center text-bold">A master pizzaiolo ‚Äî one of the <strong class="text-amber-800">most
                    awarded in Zurich</strong> ‚Äî will bring the heart of Naples to life in front of your eyes.</p>
            <p>This is a <strong>one-time-only tasting experience</strong>, where every pizza tells a story of past and
                present of Napoli.</p>

            <p>The event will unfold in an intimate setting near Helvetiaplatz, transformed for one evening into a
                <strong>Neapolitan pizza dream</strong>.</p>


            <p>From the legendary <strong>Margherita D.O.P.</strong> to modern, new and imaginative creations rarely seen
                outside Italy, our tables will be filled with <strong class="text-amber-900">pizzas meant to be
                    shared</strong>, fresh from the oven in true Italian fashion.</p>

            <p>You‚Äôll taste and share: just as they do in Naples, where pizza isn‚Äôt just food, it‚Äôs a way of life.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôve worked closely with the pizzaiolo to create a <strong>curated menu</strong> that honors the
                <strong>purest traditions of Naples</strong>, using ingredients of the highest quality flown in specially
                for the event.</p>

            <p>He will also present some <strong>new and modern Pizzas</strong>, you do not see in other Pizzerias.</p>

            <p>Now, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what awaits you...</p>

        <div class="mt-6 space-y-4">
            <img src="@image('raffaele.webp')" alt="Raffaele Tromiro" class="rounded-lg">
            <p>Raffaele Tromiro, a fourth-generation pizzaiolo from Naples, has masterfully <strong>brought the soul of
                    Neapolitan pizza</strong> to Switzerland.</p>
            <p>This passion lead him to <strong>open his first Napul√©</strong> restaurant in Meilen, in 2015.</p>
            <p>Since then, his dedication to authentic pizza-making has earned him over 300 awards, including three "Pizza
                World Champion" titles in 2006, 2008, and 2012 </p>
            <p>He developed a <strong>unique flour blend</strong> in collaboration with a Mill from Thurgau, ensuring a
                light and fragrant dough that rests for 48 hours before baking.</p>
            <p>Ingredients like mozzarella and tomatoes are <strong>personally selected</strong> from his native Naples.</p>
            <p>His philosophy equates pizza-making to poetry, requiring "<em>passionate hands and absolute dedication</em>"
                to create the perfect pie.</p>
            <p>After his adventure in Meilen, he decided to open <strong>A Taverna e Pullicinella</strong> near Helvetiaplatz.
            </p>
            <p>Contrary to Napul√©, that has more classical pizza, here Raffaele can express his creativity with new and
                modern pizzas.</p>
            <p>Just after 3 months of the opening, he was awarded with <strong>2 Spicchi Gambero Rosso</strong> as one of
                the Top Italian Restaurants in Zurich.</p>
