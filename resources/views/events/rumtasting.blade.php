        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-center">What is Rum really?</h2>
        <p>Maybe you know, but Rum is nothing else that the <strong>distilled spirit</strong> produced from the fermented juice of sugar cane or its byproducts.</p>
        <p>What is interesting about Rum is not simply the really humble origin of its raw materials. </p>
        <p>But rather, the impressive story, and sensory voyage that Rum brings with, t </p>

        <p>Each sip of a really nice and elegant rum it's a story, a voyage and <strong> a celebration of Caribbean cultures</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-center">A Journey to the Heart of the Caribbean</h2>
        <p>Exploring rum means diving into centuries of history and craftsmanship, each bottle offering a glimpse into the cultures and traditions of the islands.</p>

        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-center">A Glimpse of Rum History</h2>
        <p>Rum has been traditionally attached to Pirates.</p>
        <p>Jack Sparrow in the famous film series, was always asking or drinking rum.</p>
        <p>The infamous "<strong>grog</strong>" (a mix of rum, water, lime, and sugar) became a staple for sailors to combat scurvy and keep water supplies drinkable.</p>
        <p>The romanticization of the figure of the pirates through movies in popular culture has led Rum to be a symbol of the Caribbean and of this chapter of the history.</p>
        <p>There are many brand, like Captain Morgan that strongly attach their visuals to this legacy.</p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-xl font-semibold">Rum is not anymore just a  Pirate's drink</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this Rum Tasting is to make you discover new flavors, new tastes and maybe a new spirit</p>
        <p>A lot of people associate Rum to the supermakret quality one.</p>
        <p>A "shotter" liquer just used to make teenagers drunk at a cheap price.</p>

        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-center">There are three types of Rum</h2>
        <p>In the rum world, each bottle belongs to one of these three types:</p>

        <p>As the name suggests:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Shotters</strong>: The shotters are really bad products, with a lot of off-flavors and bad aromas, really difficult to drink, therefore you can only shot them. An example is the typical Rum sold in supermarkets. You should <span class="font-bold text-red-800">AVOID</span> them completely.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixers</strong>: Mixers belong that category of liquers are designed for making delicious cocktails.</li>
            <li><strong>Sippers</strong>: Are the most complex and elegant distillates. They are not ideal for cocktails as they are usually really dominant in flavors, and are best drank together.</li>
        </ul>
