Ciao {{ contact.first_name }},

The weekend we‚Äôve all been waiting for is coming soon! 

We can‚Äôt wait to dive into this incredible experience with you!

## We will **meet at the Hotel** 

At 12:30 we will meet at the Hotel, ready to walk towards the first restaurant. 

You can reach the hotel via Metro from the Main Station.

### The Metro in Stazione Centrale is underground!

So when you get out of the train, you are on the top floor.

Just walk down in the main Hall, and follow the **Metro C** signs, **direction San Donato**.

Metro Line: Yellow

Metro Stop: Repubblica

**Hotel Windsor Milano**

*Via Galileo Galilei, 2* ([Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jHuiKxqagAaiZRvb6))
