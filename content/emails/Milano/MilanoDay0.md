Ciao {{ contact.first_name }},

The weekend we’ve all been waiting for is coming soon! 

I can’t wait to dive into this incredible experience with you!

I am writing this email to just recap the first day.

## We will **meet at the Hotel** 

At 12:30 we will meet at the Hotel, ready to walk towards the first restaurant. 

You can reach the hotel via Metro from Stazione Centrale (Main Station).

The Stazione Centrale is like a labirinth the first time you pass through there, built on multiple levels.

### The Metro in Stazione Centrale is underground!

You can follow Google to bring you safely to destination.

**Hotel Windsor Milano**

*Via Galileo Galilei, 2* ([Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jHuiKxqagAaiZRvb6))

## What to Bring (Minimal Version)

Quick check list so you do not forget anything:

✅ Your ID or Passport

✅ The Public Transport Ticket (The orange card I gave you)

✅ Walking shoes for the day activities.

✅ An umbrella in case of unexpected Rain

✅ A jacket, it may be chilly in the evening.

✅ A Big Appetite! 🍝

✅ Credit Card for Shopping 🛍️


I'm really looking forward for this trip! 

See you tomorrow! :)
