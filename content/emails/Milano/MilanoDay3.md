# Welcome to Milano

Good morning!

Today is our last day together. I hope you had fun in these two days!

You can leave your luggages at the reception of the hotel. **The check-out is at 11:00**.

For the morning you are free to visit the city, we will only go straight to the last restaurant.

We will **meet at the Hotel** at 12:15, ready to walk towards the last restaurant.

After the lunch, you will be free to go back to the Hotel, do the last shopping or head straight back to Zurich.


## Highlights 

Today I want to keep it more relaxed. 

Our restaurant for today is the restaurant of Max Mariola.

Chef Max Mariola is an really famous and renowned culinary expert who has gained widespread recognition in recent years. 

Known for his exceptional cooking skills, innovative recipes, and charismatic presence, he has captivated food lovers with exclusive dining experiences.

The restaurant opened last years and went fully booked for months.
