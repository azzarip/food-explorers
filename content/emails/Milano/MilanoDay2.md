# Buongiorno

Good morning!

I hope you slept well! 

The breakfast should be ready downstairs if you still have not had it.

Today's plan it is quite simple.

We will **meet at the Hotel** at 11:00, ready to walk and we will take the tram to go towards the castle, _Castello Sforzesco_.

## Today's Highlights

We will do a visit of the _Castello Sforzesco_, Milanâ€™s majestic medieval fortress, rich with history and stunning architecture.

For lunch, weâ€™ll head to **Pizzeria da Zero**, one of the most renowned pizzerias in Milan. Of all the pizzerias in the city, this one stands out as my personal favorite!  

I highly recommend trying their Margherita with yellow tomatoes, a rare combination outside of Italy.

At 15:00, weâ€™ll explore the **Duomo di Milano**, including a visit to its magnificent terraces for a panoramic view of the city.

To end the day in style, at 20:00, **Imbarco 10** will welcome us with an exquisite fish tasting menu, featuring their signature lobster dish as the star of the evening.
