# Welcome to Milano

Good morning,

I hope you slept well! 

The breakfast should be ready downstairs if you still have not had it.

Today's plan it is quite simple.

We will **meet at the Hotel** at 11:00, ready to walk and we will take the tram to go towards the castle, _Castello Sforzesco_.

For lunch we go to out for Pizza and in the early afternoon we will be visiting the dome and its terraces. 

After the visit, you are free until dinner at 20:00. The restaurant is next to the hotel, so we will meet at the hotel.
