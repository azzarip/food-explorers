# Welcome to Milano

Dear {{ contact.first_name }},

The weekend we’ve all been waiting for is finally here! 

Whether you're on a train, a plane, or already strolling through the streets of Milan, get ready for an **unforgettable culinary experience**.

We will **meet at the Hotel** around 12:30, ready to walk towards the first restaurant. 

The room maybe not ready yet, since the **check-in starts at 14:00**, but the Hotel will keep your luggages there in their lockers.

The **rooms are booked with your name**, so just tell the concierge your name and they will have the room ready for you.

## How to reach the Hotel

The main station of Milano is quite confusing. Trains arrive on the top floor. 

After you get out there are escalators to reach the ground floor. 

**To reach the metro**, you just follow the big red M signs, there is another set of escalators, just outside the main building that bring you to the metro stops.

Metro arrive every 5 minutes, just follow the yellow line 🟡 **direction S. Donato**.

The first stop is the hotel stop: Repubblica. The hotel is just around the block.

Just write me in case you need any help!

Enjoy your travel and see you soon, 🚆✈️🍽️
