# Welcome to Milano

Dear {{ contact.first_name }},

The weekend we’ve all been waiting for is finally here! 

Whether you're on a train, a plane, or already strolling through the streets of Milan, get ready for an **unforgettable culinary experience**.

We will **meet at the Hotel** around 12:30, ready to walk towards the first restaurant. 

The room maybe not ready yet, since the **check-in starts at 14:00**, but the Hotel will keep your luggages there in their lockers.

The **rooms are booked with your name**, so just tell the concierge your name and they will have the room ready for you.
