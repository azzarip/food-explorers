Hi {{ contact.first_name }},

Paris is more than just a city; it’s a **culinary legend** in itself.

And as an Italian, let me tell you: no one does food quite like the Parisians. 

Paris has a **unique magic**, a deep, almost **sacred romantic relationship with food** that stretches through centuries, blending tradition with innovation in ways few places can match.

You’ve likely savored the grandeur of its iconic sights and famous restaurants before, but what if you could **unlock a side of Paris most visitors never see?** 

A side of the city where the food is **not only delicious but authentic, hidden, and uniquely Parisian**.

Welcome to a food adventure unlike any other.

Before I continue, I want to make it clear:

## This is not 'another' food tour

Let’s make one thing clear: this is not your average walking tour with pit stops at street food stalls or the usual touristy things.

This is not a "first-time-in-Paris" visit to Paris.

## This is a deep dive into the heart of Parisian gastronomy

A journey for the true connoisseur, crafted to amaze even the most discerning of food lovers.

Over three days, you’ll discover the **hidden gems** and **legendary chefs** that truly define Paris. 

We're talking about places off the beaten path, where the **locals dine**, where authentic Parisian food tells stories of centuries of culinary history.

Three days of discovering the best and most delicious restaurants. 

# The Most Underrated Cuisine of Paris

Paris has many many many food styles and cuisines that have been developing over the last decades.

You’ve probably heard of _haute cuisine_, _nouvelle cuisine_ and other famous French concepts.

But there’s one style that quietly stole the heart of Parisians: and it’s now the true soul of the city’s food scene.

## The Bistrots

For most of the people, Bistrots are simply _small and cozy restaurant_, maybe with wooden decor and wine bottles on the walls.


I know that many people connect the word with tourist traps: if you walk along the Seine, it is easy to step into many restaurants also called "Bistrot", but just used as a buzz word.

Since the early '90s, bistrots have become the **beating heart of Parisian gastronomy**.

There is a **whole culinary movement** called Bistronomie. About which I will talk more in future emails I will send you.

Bistros are more than just _small, cozy restaurants_, they are where the **soul of Parisian** food lives.

But don’t expect the usual, overcrowded touristy spots. 

I’m taking you to the bistros that true Parisians swear by. These are places where simple, fresh ingredients come together to create dishes that feel like a warm embrace. 

**This is why I say**: 

## Parisian Bistrots are underrated

Most of Bistrots are just tourist traps, but there are some, hidden from the usual landmarks and tourist locations that are jewels you cannot miss.

Here, food is not just sustenance, it’s a **celebration of French gastronomy**.

In just three days, you’ll uncover a **hidden Paris** that most visitors miss.

This isn’t about following a map or ticking off the usual **“must-dos**”. 

It’s about **feeling Paris**, about engaging with the city through its food, and experiencing something extraordinary.

I’ve named this journey **Petit Paris** because it’s not just a visit, it’s a personal invitation to discover the city’s intimate culinary corners.

Tomorrow, we’ll dive deeper into the **world of bistros** and explore how they are reshaping the **future of French cuisine**.

And I will start presenting the first restaurants that we will visit in this french adventure.

## I hope you’ll join us on this exclusive adventure

When you return home, it won’t just be the delicious meals you’ll carry with you. **You’ll take home memories**: memories that can’t be found in any guidebook or on a popular blog.

Have a nice day,

Marco
