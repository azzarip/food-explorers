Dear Food Explorer, 

I can’t wait to take you to Paris. And now, it’s official:

# 📅 Friday 3 to Sunday 5 October

We’ll begin with our first lunch together on **Friday around 1:00 PM**, and close the experience with a final, unforgettable meal on Sunday, **finishing around 5:00 PM**.

This weekend will be a tribute to the true soul of Paris: hidden bistrots, culinary secrets, long dinners, rare wines and slow lunches.

**Your responsibility** is to come on Paris on time.

Once you are there I will take care of you, and make you live the most amazing Parisian foodie holiday you can dream of.

Hotels, restaurants, surprises—you’ll be free to immerse yourself completely in the experience.

If you decide to come I will provide all the info for your departure. There’s a super easy option:

You can take the **direct train that arrives around 11:40 AM**, giving you enough time to drop off your luggage, refresh, and get ready to meet the group.

Prefer to fly? That works too.

Both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports are well-connected, and I’ll help you plan your best option.

## ⚠️ Important: Limited Spots

Many of you signed up for this Paris trip, and I’m honestly thrilled.

But here’s the thing: **I can’t host everyone**.

We’ll go forward in the order of who confirms personally. **This trip is small and intimate** by design—it’s the only way to preserve the magic.

Also many bistrot do not accept many guest. And I want to respect this. 

End of the week I will start sending the printed version of the program, next week I will open the bookings when everything is confirmed!

### Let’s make this one of those weekends you’ll talk about for years.

Have a nice evening,

Marco
