subject: "Three Desserts You Can Taste in Paris (and Never Forget)"
---

Dear Food Explorer, 

If there’s one thing that brings a perfect Parisian meal to its rightful close, it’s dessert.

And in our upcoming adventure, **you won’t just try one, you’ll taste many**. 

Each bistrot has its own way of saying _“au revoir”_ to the meal, and every time, it’s unforgettable.

The usual suspects are there: **croissants, pain au chocolat** and **macarons**.

## 1. Viennoiserie

Every morning, if you are up for a walk, instead of visiting the usual hotel breakfast, we can dive in one of the many Parisians boulangeries.

The **croissants** and the **pain au chocolat** are two of the standards you will find in every bakery.

And many legends tell that the best croissants are the one you find before 9 am in the morning.

There are **city-wide competitions** each year to crown the best croissant or best baguette, and the winners proudly display their awards in the window.

Each *boulanger* has their own secret:  

Who uses a special butter from Normandy, another swears by stone-ground flour from Brittany, some go for rich, dark golden crusts, others for a lighter, flakier finish.  

You think you’ve had a croissant before, until you bite into one of these.  

**Still warm, impossibly light, crispy outside, melting inside.**

With an incredible aroma that fills the room, wherever you are.

## 2. Fontainebleau – The French Cousin of Tiramisu

Let's make the french cringe and sweat cold, and let's call it the french cousin of the tiramisu.

Imagine a dessert so light, so airy, it feels like biting into a cloud.  

That’s Fontainebleau: a mix of whipped cream and fresh cheese (Fontainebleu), folded together until it barely holds its shape.

Delicate. Subtle. With luxurious toppings.

The cream is usually **garnished with different sauces and toppings**.

It’s the kind of dessert that disappears before you realize how much you loved it.

This one you can find in many Bistrot, especially in the more modern ones.

## 3. Pate a Choux

Now let’s talk about the little wonders that **look delicate but deliver big emotions**.

Welcome to the world of **pâte à choux**, to use the right accents.

It’s the dough behind some of the most iconic French pastries:  

**éclairs, choux à la crème, religieuses**—and every single one of them hides a surprise inside.

From the outside, they look simple:  

A golden shell, crisp yet airy, almost hollow. But that’s just the invitation.

Inside? A cloud of **vanilla bean custard**, rich **chocolate ganache**, or even tangy **passionfruit cream** waiting to be discovered.

Some of them even with ice cream.

You might taste one with a **shiny glaze** so perfect it reflects your face.  

Another topped with praline, or filled at the last second to keep the shell just crisp enough.

# And many many more

It is not a visit to Paris if you skip on dessert.

After all, no dessert tour of Paris would be complete without a few bites of this delicious magic.

The city is crawling with bakeries and pastry shop with any sort of dessert and sweet.

These ones are just the most typical and what I go for every time I go to Paris.

## If you like desserts you cannot miss this trip to Paris!
