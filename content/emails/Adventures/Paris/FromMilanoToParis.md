subject: From Milano To Paris - Our Next Culinary Adventure!
---

Dear Food Explorer, 

Our unforgettable trip to Milano has come to an end, and I hope you **had an amazing time** during this first weekend together!

Right now, you‚Äôre on the train back to Z√ºrich, and soon, your daily routine will take over again. 

Monday meetings, email, zoom calls... The same office, the same tasks, the same routine. 

But as you sip your coffee and scroll through your inbox, let your mind drift for a moment‚Äîback to the lively streets of Milano, the flavors of our shared meals, the laughter, the discoveries.

Because who says adventure has to end just because the weekend is over?

**What if, instead of settling back into the everyday job, you had something extraordinary to look forward to?**

 A new destination, a new experience, a chance to dive into another adventure of flavors and stories?

# Our next stop: Paris üá´üá∑

Our next stop is the City of Lights, where we will embark on a **carefully curated three-day culinary journey** through Paris‚Äôs vibrant bistrot scene.

Organizing this trip took me even longer than Milano: 

Simply because **Paris is a vast and ever-evolving gastronomic capital**, shaped by different culinary movements over the years.

It was really difficult finding 3 restaurant that could match the level. There are so many, that it was really difficult to choose.

Each day, we‚Äôll explore a new side of Parisian cuisine, savoring incredible dishes in three exceptional bistrots, uncovering hidden food treasures, and savoring unforgettable dining experiences. 

Along the way, we‚Äôll also step into some of the city‚Äôs most intriguing secret bars and lesser-known gems.

Imagine strolling through charming cobblestone streets, the scent of freshly baked croissants in the air, and the warm glow of vintage street lamps guiding your way. 

I called this trip **Petit Paris**, because it‚Äôs not about aristocratic, ultra-formal _Haute Cuisine_.

Instead, I want to take you into the heart of the city's most lively and authentic bistrots‚Äîwhere locals gather, where history meets innovation, and where the true essence of Parisian dining comes to life.

## What is a Bistrot Exactly?

The word Bistrot is used all over Europe to **indicate a small restaurant with a few seats**, in a cozy setting.

Is it the same in Paris? Yes but is also something more.

It‚Äôs **not about fine dining or extravagant dishes**; it‚Äôs about simplicity, quality, and atmosphere. A true bistrot is warm, unpretentious, and deeply rooted in daily life.

The menu is often handwritten on a chalkboard, changing daily based on what‚Äôs fresh and in season.

What matters most is that the food is flavorful, and deeply satisfying.

That is also why I called this trip **Petit Paris**, I will bring you into the **heart of the city**, not just as a tourist, but to experience the more daily life and daily food of Paris like the Parisians do.

I want to help you discover the ‚Äú_smaller_‚Äù cuisine, less aristocratic, but no less delicious or important.

Paris is so imbued in the culture of Bistrot, that a french food critic named this new cuisine wave: "**_Bistronomie_**".

## A Bistrot Menu is not a endless book

A bistrot menu is not a book with endless pages of choices, often it does not even exist in printed version. 

You may get a chalkboard with the items written on it, or simply a freshly printed paper with the selection of the day.

Simply three dishes: one entr√©e, one plat, one dessert.

Each bite tells a story of the season, of the market‚Äôs freshest finds, of a chef‚Äôs inspiration in that very moment.

**You choose the menu** depending on what the kitchen and the market offers that day. 

Here is some pictures of what may be waiting for you in Paris:
