subject: From Milano To Paris - Our Next Food Adventure!
---

Dear Food Explorer, 

Our unforgettable trip to Milano has come to an end, and I hope you **had an amazing time** during this first weekend together!

I hope Monday meetings, email, and zoom calls treated you well.

But as you are reading this email, let your mind drift for a moment‚Äîback to the lively streets of Milano, the flavors of our shared meals, the laughter, the discoveries.

Because who says adventure has to end just because the weekend is over?

 A new destination, a new experience, a chance to dive into another adventure of flavors and stories is coming!

# Our next stop: Paris üá´üá∑

Our next stop is the City of Lights, where we will embark on a **carefully curated three-day culinary journey** through Paris‚Äôs romantic bistrot scene.

**Paris is a vast and ever-evolving gastronomic capital**, shaped by the different culinary movements that gre over the years.

It was really difficult finding 3 restaurant that could match the level of Milano. 

Not because of the quality, but because there are so many, that it was really difficult to choose.

Each day, we‚Äôll explore a new side of Parisian cuisine, savoring incredible dishes in three exceptional bistrots, uncovering hidden food treasures, and savoring unforgettable dining experiences. 

Along the way, we‚Äôll also step into some of the city‚Äôs most intriguing secret bars and lesser-known gems.

Imagine strolling through charming cobblestone streets, the scent of freshly baked croissants in the air, and the warm glow of vintage street lamps guiding your way. 

I called this trip **Petit Paris**, because it will not revolve around aristocratic, ultra-formal _Haute Cuisine_.

Instead, I want to take you into the heart of the city's most lively and authentic bistrots, where locals gather, where chef innovate their cuisine, and where the true essence of Parisian dining comes to life.

## What is a Bistrot Exactly?

The word Bistrot is used all over Europe to **indicate a small restaurant with a few seats**, in a cozy setting.

Is it the same in Paris? Yes, but is also something more.

It‚Äôs **not about fancy dining or extravagant dishes**; it‚Äôs about simplicity, quality, and atmosphere. A true bistrot is warm, unpretentious, and deeply rooted in daily life.

The menu is often handwritten on a chalkboard, changing daily based on what‚Äôs fresh and in season.

What matters most is that the food is flavorful, and deeply satisfying.

That is also why I called this trip **Petit Paris**, I will bring you into the **life of Paris**, not just as a tourist, but to experience the more daily life and daily food of Paris like the Parisians do.

I want to help you discover the ‚Äú_smaller_‚Äù cuisine, less formal, but no less delicious or important.

Paris is so imbued in the culture of Bistrot, that a french food critic named this new cuisine wave: "**_Bistronomie_**".

### To dive deep into the program of this weekend 

In the coming days, you‚Äôll receive a few emails with more details about our plans for these days in October. 

This time I scheduled them correctly! :P (hope) 

Have a nice start of the week,

Marco
