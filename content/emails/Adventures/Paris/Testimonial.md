Hi!

Today's email is going to be a bit different.

I won't tell you something more about our travel to Paris, but I wan't to let someone else describe the trip.

If you are curious to hear a second voice for the trip to Paris, **this email is for you**.

On the 20th of March, me and Daniel went together for a "_test drive_" of the Petit Paris adventure.

Here is what he said:

Ehm, what is that?
                
When I first heard about this so-called "_Bistrot Tour_" in Paris, I was skeptical, to say the least.

Why would I spend a whole weekend hopping from one tiny, noisy restaurant to another?

French bistros aren’t they just overpriced tourist traps serving the same old french toast? 

The first day, we started with a more traditional restaurant theme. 

 Imagine this, small restaurant, tiny old wooden tables, people speaking only French… 
 
 I expected nothing special, but then came the first bite: a perfectly cooked lamb with a sauce so rich
                    and complex. 
                    
The place was packed, the waiters attentive and efficient, the atmosphere full with real Parisians, not a
                    single turist in sight.

And the waiters and their service was top-notch.

But what really blew my mind was the dessert. 

You know how you always get this tiramisu or some industrial style cake with some ice cream on the side.
               
Well, what I got was incredible...

 It was pistachio cream, crème fresh with a sauce of roses and all this topped with crunchy nuts. I can
                    tell you, my senses were amazed for the rest of the day. 
                 
**Day two: "Neo-Bistrot."**

As a lover of traditional cuisine, I didn’t know what to expect, and I was not really understanding the difference between Bistrots, but when you taste it, you completely understand the difference between the styles. 

**This was not pretentious; this was innovation.**               

A beef steak paired with a beetroot purée and Korean kimchi that somehow made perfect sense.
                 
And the bread! 

Can you imagine falling in love with a simple slice of bread?
                
By the third day, we visited the “Hidden Gem”. I had already accepted my fate. 
                
Bring it on, I thought. And they did. A hidden gem in an alley I would have never found on my own.
            
An old factory reconverted to a restaurant.

We tasted 7 dishes in a perfectly paced lunch, from fresh asparagus smoked in the wood-fired oven of the
                    restaurant, to a “crepe” with sea-hurchins and roasted pidgeon.

I would have never thought that a street rat could taste so good.
                
I could talk for hours how amazing Paris is.

I will definitely come back and see what they offer in the autumn.

**This tour? Absolutely worth it.**

If you, like me, think you have seen it all, trust me, you haven’t.

Book the trip.

Eat the food. 
 
 And prepare to be amazed.
