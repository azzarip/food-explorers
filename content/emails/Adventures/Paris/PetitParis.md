Dear Food Explorer, 

I hope the Monday was not too rough, and your daily routine has not already taken over.

It was just yesterday when we were on the lively streets of Milano, with aperos on the rooftops, tasting the most delicious italian meals, and try new and delicious dishes. 

Our weekend in Milano has just finished. 

But our adventures do not have to stop right now.

A new destination, a new experience, a chance to dive into another adventure of flavors and stories?

# Petit Paris: An Adventure through Parisian Bistrots

The european capital of food is waiting for you.

Petit Paris is our next foodie adventure through parisian bistrots, where **you don’t just visit Paris**: you live it, taste it, and feel its
romantic soul through every dish.

Each day we’ll savor a variety of dishes, with **unforgettable restaurants** and visit **hidden bars**, and discover **local food treasures**,
all while uncovering the city’s most enchanting **hidden gems**.

This isn't just a weekend trip—it's a **Parisian fairy tale for food lovers**, a culinary adventure where every moment is sprinkled with
delicious and unforgettable flavors.

The word “petit” means “little” in French.

France, and especially Paris has been the capital of Haute Cuisine.

The term "_haute cuisine_" doesn't just refer to high-end restaurants but also to the **entire experience**: refined techniques, artful presentations, and meticulously structured meals served in exclusive, aristocratic settings.

In Paris, it’s easy to find places where **a single meal costs hundreds of euros**, lasts five hours, and unfolds in an atmosphere of utmost formality. But that’s not the Paris I love.

I called this adventure Petit Paris because I want to help you discover the “smaller” cuisine, less aristocratic, but no less delicious or important.

## Bistronomie: the "petit cuisine" of Paris

This trip is all about exploring **the most characteristics Bistrots** of Paris.

A Bistrot, in "common terms" is a really small and cozy restaurant, with few limited seatings.

In Paris, this definition holds but has a more specific definition.

A Bistrot is a really small restaurant, their menu changes frequently - monthly, if not weekly, for some cases even daily!

For the French, a bistrot is where people come together to share a meal, a conversation, and a moment of their day.

It’s not about fine dining or extravagant dishes; it’s about simplicity, quality, and atmosphere. 

### A true bistrot is warm, unpretentious, and deeply rooted in daily life.

Regulars greet the owner by name, and the waiters move effortlessly between tables closely packed between each other.

Old wooden furniture, small chair and some white tableclothes are the only decorations. Maybe opened bottles of wine collected through the years…

**What matters most is that the food is simple, flavorful, and deeply satisfying.**

A bistrot is Paris in its purest form. 

It’s not designed to impress; it’s designed to make you feel at home—whether you’re a local or a visitor. And once you’ve experienced it, you’ll understand why the French cherish it so much.

That is the beauty of these places: **fresh ingredient, new recipes that reflect the season and the chef ’s inspiration for the day**.

Because of this, **there’s no fixed menu for our trip**. That’s part of the adventure!

Rather than focusing on a set list of dishes, **I’ve carefully selected each bistrot** based on its quality, atmosphere, and culinary creativity.

# Bistrots' Menus

A bistrot menu is not a book with endless pages of choices, often it does not even exist in printed version.

A bistrot embraces spontaneity and freshness, crafting dishes based on what’s best at the market that day.

A traditional French bistrot meal follows the **Entrée + Plat + Dessert** structure.

These are three courses that create a deeply satisfying experience.

#### Entrée

The entrée is the starter, usually something light but full of character.

Not to be confused with the American "Entrée" which means main course.


#### Plat 

Or simply main course.

Where the heart of the bistrot’s cooking shines. 

Here you get your meat, your fish or whatever else you ordered. They all come with sides and sauces all in the same dish.

#### Dessert 

Finally, the dessert, which the French treat with just as much respect as the rest of the meal. 

Usually bistrot won’t serve extravagant, modern creations—desserts here are classics, perfected over generations.


**ATTENTION**

Desserts are included!

Contrary to the Milan trip, I have decided to include the desserts in Paris. 

Not only they are included, but they are mandatory. If you don’t have dessert in Paris, I am ashamed of you.

So in each of the restaurant you will get these three dishes: Entrée, Plat and Dessert.

You will choose your own preferred dish from the menu that the restaurant will hand in that day. 

The menus are decided often on a weekly basis.

Each bite tells a story of the season, of the market’s freshest finds, of a chef’s inspiration in that very moment.

**You choose the menu** depending on what the kitchen and the market offers that day. 

Here is some pictures of what may be waiting for you in Paris:
