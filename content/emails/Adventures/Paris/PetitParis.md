Dear Food Explorer, 

Our next adventure will be in the European Capital of Food.


Petit Paris is our next foodie adventure through parisian bistrots, where **you don’t just visit Paris**: you live it, taste it, and feel its
romantic soul through every dish.

This isn't just a weekend trip—it's a **Parisian fairy tale for food lovers**, a culinary adventure where every moment is sprinkled with
delicious and unforgettable flavors.


# Petit Paris: An Adventure through Parisian Bistrots

France and especially Paris, has lived through many gastronomical movements. 

Most probably, you have heard of "_Haute Cuisine_" or "_Nouvelle Cuisine_".

These are just two of the names of culinary wave that France experienced.


The term "_haute cuisine_" doesn't just refer to high-end restaurants but also to the **entire experience**: refined techniques, artful presentations, and meticulously structured meals served in exclusive, aristocratic settings.

In Paris, it’s easy to find places where **a single meal costs hundreds of euros**, lasts five hours, and unfolds in an atmosphere of utmost formality. But that’s not the Paris I love.

The word “_petit_” means “_little_” in French.

I called this adventure Petit Paris because I want to help you discover the “smaller” cuisine, less aristocratic, but no less delicious or important.

## Bistronomie: the "petit cuisine" of Paris

This trip is all about exploring **the most characteristics Bistrots** of Paris.

A Bistrot, in "common terms" is a really small and cozy restaurant, with few limited seatings.

A Bistrot is a really small restaurant, their menu changes frequently - monthly, if not weekly, for some cases even daily!

For the French, a bistrot is where people come together to share a meal, a conversation, and a moment of their day.

It’s not about fancy dining or extravagant dishes; it’s about simplicity, quality, and atmosphere. 

### A true bistrot is warm, unpretentious, and deeply rooted in daily life.

Regulars greet the owner by name, and the waiters move effortlessly between tables closely packed between each other.

Old wooden furniture, small chair and some white tableclothes are the only decorations. Maybe opened bottles of wine collected through the years…

**What matters most is that the food is simple, flavorful, and deeply satisfying.**

You will find in Paris the bistrots in their purest form. 

It’s not designed to impress; it’s designed to make you feel at home—whether you’re a local or a visitor. And once you’ve experienced it, you’ll understand why the Parisians cherish it so much.

That is the beauty of these places: **fresh ingredient, new recipes that reflect the season and the chef ’s inspiration for the day**.

Because of this, **there’s no fixed menu for our trip**. That’s part of the adventure!

Rather than focusing on a set list of dishes, **I’ve carefully selected each bistrot** based on its quality, atmosphere, and culinary creativity.

# Bistrots' Menus

A bistrot menu is not a book with endless pages of choices, often it does not even exist in printed version.

A bistrot embraces spontaneity and freshness, crafting dishes based on what’s best at the market that day.

A traditional French bistrot meal follows the **Entrée + Plat + Dessert** structure.

These are three courses that create a deeply satisfying experience.

#### Entrée

The entrée is the starter, usually something light but full of character.

Not to be confused with the American "Entrée" which means main course.


#### Plat 

Or simply main course.

Where the heart of the bistrot’s cooking shines. 

Here you get your meat, your fish or whatever else you ordered. They all come with sides and sauces all in the same dish.

#### Dessert 

Finally, the dessert, which the French treat with just as much respect as the rest of the meal. 

Usually bistrot won’t serve extravagant, modern creations—desserts here are classics, perfected over time.

## ATTENTION: Desserts are included!

Contrary to the Milan trip, I have decided to include the desserts in Paris. 

Not only they are included, but they are mandatory. If you don’t have dessert in Paris, I am ashamed of you.

So in each of the 3 Bistorts that we will visit, you will get these three dishes: Entrée, Plat and Dessert.

You will choose your own preferred dish from the menu that the restaurant will hand in that day. 

The menus are decided often on a weekly basis.

## What to expect

You will find in the booklet pictures of the dishes of the past seasons.

I cannot guarantee those dishes will be in the menu. 

But you can expect: 2 Meat dishes, 1 Fish dish and 1 Vegetarian option.

I was in Paris at end of March, and all of them offered these 3 or 4 options for the entrées and the plats.

**You choose the menu** depending on what the kitchen and the market offers that day. 

# A Special Invite for you

If you dream of strolling through the cobbled streets of Montmartre, soaking in the romance of Paris with every bite and sip…

**For one exclusive night, the magic of Paris comes to Zurich!**

We will visit the **Bistrot Montmartre**, in Zurich Altstadt, near St. Peter’s Church, where you will embark on a Bistrot experience that will transport you straight to the heart of France. 

This enchanting bistrot is the little sister of the more famous the “Franzos”.

Just a few tables are available in this little restaurant nested between the buildings of the Old City of Zurich.

## This is a dinner crafted to whisk you away to Paris for one night. 

The ambiance, the flavors, it’s as if you stepped into a hidden Bistrot tucked away in Montmartre, without ever leaving Zurich.
