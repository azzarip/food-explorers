Hi {{ contact.first_name }}, 

We’ve explored the world of Bistrots together, and if you’ve been following our journey, you know: they’re more than restaurants.

After two unforgettable days of culinary adventures, **Sunday is meant to slow down**. 

For the last lunch together I want to bring you **somewhere different**.

**Not another Bistrot.**

But still has many elements in common with Parisian Bistronomie.

Maybe one more flaky croissant at a favorite boulangerie, or a quiet stroll through a hidden street. Perhaps a little boutique catch your eye. 

Our path will take us toward the **Saint-Ambroise quarter**, in the **11th arrondissement**, known for its cozy cafés, local bistros, and creative shops.

## The Hidden Gem of Paris

The kind that food critics whisper about.  

The kind that’s **about to earn a Michelin star**, but hasn’t quite yet.  

So we’re catching it right before the rest of the world does.

### The chef isn’t trying to impress anyone.  

He’s simply doing what he loves: **crafting unforgettable dishes from seasonal treasures**, guided by instinct, precision, and years of experience in both Japan and France.

He spent years in the French haute cuisine world before creating a space that reflects **his own language of cooking**.

The setting is warm, intimate, and elegant. 

An **open kitchen** replaces stiff formality with a sense of calm choreography.

His team doesn’t serve you, but they host you.  

**There’s no menu published.** Not even on the website.

What you’ll taste depends on what’s in season, and what inspired the chef that very morning.

Each dish is a story of the season, local and fresh.

**We’ll be among the few to experience it while it’s still a hidden treasure,** before the waiting list gets months long and the prices reach haute-cuisine heights.

Here you can find many of the dishes they presented through-out the last year:

Of course the menu changes even daily sometimes, don’t get too attached—these dishes may already be gone. 

The menu changes often, like the seasons.

Let’s keep this journey going!

## Do you want to join us for the trip to Paris?

**Just write me a whatsapp message**.

I will put on the list!

The **deadline** is Monday 28th, afterwards I will opene the remaining spots to other people of the group who could not join the Milano trip.

**Just a few people have not confirmed yet...**

Do you really want to miss this next trip together?

Marco
