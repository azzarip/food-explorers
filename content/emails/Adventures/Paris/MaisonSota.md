Hi {{ contact.first_name }},  

As we continue to explore the world of Bistrots together, and if you’ve been following the journey, you know they’re more than restaurants.  

They’re living rooms of a city that speaks in flavors.  

For the last lunch together I want to bring you **somewhere different**.

**Not another Bistrot.**

But it won’t feel like an ending.  

It will feel like **something different**.

## A Place That Isn’t Listed in the Guidebooks  

Tucked away in a quiet street of the **11th arrondissement**, where the rhythm of Paris slows and the crowds thin, there’s a door you could easily walk past.  

And yet… behind it lies one of the **most soulful kitchens in all of Paris**.  

You don't find this restaurant if you don't know where it is.

No flashy signs. No hype. Just **quiet excellence**.  

The kind that’s **just one step away from a Michelin star**.  

So we’re catching it right before the rest of the world does.

## The Chef  

He doesn’t chase trends.  

He doesn’t crave fame.  

He simply **cooks from the soul**.  

He has background from decades of **French haute cuisine** and blends in the influences from its family past. 

There’s no printed menu. Almost no marketing.  

What’s served is decided by instinct and ingredients—**that week**.

I have been already there, and each time is different. 

And what comes to the table… is quiet magic.  

One week truffle, one week game birds, one week sea urchins...

## The Experience  

The space is minimal, warm, and honest.  

There’s an **open kitchen**, but no separation.  

Amazing waiters.

You’re not eating _at_ the restaurant.  

You’re **part of it**.  

Each dish feels like a whisper:  “_This is what the season tastes like, right now.”_  

It’s one of the most **emotionally moving** meals I’ve had in years.  And I want to share it with you.

## But I won’t tell you the name—yet.  

Some things are best revealed only when the moment is right.  

This is one of them.  

Just know: it’s the kind of place that in a few months will have **a waiting list**, and prices to match.  

Especially if they are going to win the Michelin Star, the prices will double instantly, and the waitlist will explode. 

We’ll be there **before that happens**.  

We’ll say, _“I remember when...”_

Don’t get too attached.  
**By the time we go, it will have changed again.**
