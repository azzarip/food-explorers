Hi {{ contact.first_name }}, 

We’ve talked a lot about Bistrots, and if you’ve been following along, you’ve probably started to feel how deep their **roots run in Paris**. 

They’re not just "_places to eat_”. 

For a foodie, they’re part of the city’s rhythm, like the smell of warm baguettes or the image of Notre Dame.

In the last years **a new movement emerged from the ideas and philosophy of the Bistronomie**.

The principles of Bistronomie are simple: fresh and local ingredients, modest settings, casual environment.

But some young chefs decided to bring it forward.

## A new Language of Bistrot: Neo-Bistrots

These places don’t shout loud.

It is a word that not even Parisians use that much, only the **serious foodies** and **gastronomy** people.


A few **young chefs**, often just back from travels abroad or from years behind Michelin-star kitchens, start cooking the way they want.

No uniforms. No grand prix-fixe menus.

Just technique, creativity, and a focus on what’s in season today.

### Neo-bistrots are not afraid to break rules.

Their ideas are simple, bringing all from different cuisines and different experiences into a new and modern gastronomy: the **neo-bistronomie**.

Some incorporate **global influences**, while others strip dishes down to their purest essence. 

Still pure France cuisine, France style and Bistrot setting, but with the idea to look at something new.

 The only constant is an obsession with taste and a **commitment to delivering an exceptional dining experience**.

## Our Last Bistrot

On Saturday night, we’ll walk through the narrow streets of **Le Marais**, just before dinner hour. 

Windows will glow. The city will slow down. 

And we’ll step into the **last bistrot** and almost unique Bistrot of our Paris journey.

This spot is run by a young, tight-knit crew, and you can **feel the energy** the moment you arrive. 

They move fast but with care, plating each dish like it matters. They’re not following a playbook, they’re writing their own.

**You might taste something familiar**: a slow-cooked jus, a delicate French sauce. But then it might be paired with something you didn’t expect: miso, seaweed, a hint of citrus.

That’s the heart of neo-bistronomie: honoring where it all came from, while **exploring what it can become**.

### Rooted in French tradition and updated with bold, modern freshness

The neo-bistrot experience is about savoring food at its finest, without the barriers of traditions.

Tradition for this new generation is a starting point, **not the end-point**.

Here is a selection of the dishes:

Of course the menu changes weekly, don’t get too attached to these dishes, they may already be gone. The menu changes often, like the seasons.

It’s a chance to taste newly created flavors, creative dishes, and the relaxed yet refined atmosphere that defines this new wave of Parisian gastronomy.
