subject: "[8/10] The Third Bistrot: Neo-Bistrots"
---

Hi {{ contact.first_name }}, 

We’ve talked a lot about Bistrots, and if you’ve been following along, you’ve probably started to feel how deep their roots run in Paris. 

They’re not just “places to eat.” They’re part of the city’s rhythm, like the smell of warm baguettes or the image of Notre Dame.

In the last years **a new movement emerged from the ideas and philosophy of the Bistronomie**.

The principles of Bistronomie are simple: fresh and local ingredients, modest settings, casual environment.

But some young chefs decided to bring it forward.

## A new Language of Bistrot: Neo-Bistrots

These places don’t shout. They whisper something different.

A few **young chefs**, often just back from stints abroad or from years behind Michelin-star kitchens, **take small spaces—bare walls, open kitchens**, a few well-loved chairs, and start cooking the way they want.

No uniforms. No grand prix-fixe menus.

Just technique, creativity, and a focus on what’s in season today.

### Neo-bistrots are not afraid to break rules.

Their ideas are simple, bringing all from different cuisines and different experiences into a new and modern gastronomy: the **neo-bistronomie**.

Some incorporate **global influences**, while others strip dishes down to their purest essence. 

The only constant is an obsession with taste and a **commitment to delivering an exceptional dining experience**.

## Our Last Bistrot

On Saturday night, we’ll walk through the narrow streets of **Le Marais**, just before dinner hour. Windows will glow. The city will slow down. 

And we’ll step into the **last bistrot** of our Paris journey, but not our last restaurant.

This spot is run by a young, tight-knit crew, and you can feel the energy the moment you arrive. 

They move fast but with care, plating each dish like it matters. They’re not following a playbook—they’re writing their own.

**You might taste something familiar**: a slow-cooked jus, a delicate French sauce. But then it might be paired with something you didn’t expect—miso, seaweed, a hint of citrus.

That’s the heart of neo-bistronomie: honoring where it all came from, while **exploring what it can become**.

Here’s a glimpse at what they’ve served recently:



Located in the trendy "_Le Marais_", a group of really young guys have opened a restaurant which embraces fully the neo-bistrot spirit.

### Rooted in French tradition and updated with bold, modern creativity.

The neo-bistrot experience is about savoring food at its finest, without the barriers of traditions.


Here is a selection of the dishes:

Of course the menu changes weekly, don’t get too attached—these dishes may already be gone. The menu changes often, like the seasons.

It’s a chance to taste newly created flavors, creative dishes, and the relaxed yet refined atmosphere that defines this new wave of Parisian gastronomy.

## A neo-bistrot here in Zurich

A few of us already tasted this spirit last Tuesday, at Montmartre. 

But just across town, a new neo-bistrot has quietly opened here in Zürich too.


**If you decide to join us**, I am bringing all the people who signed up there for a taste of this Zurich-Paris connection.

## How to sign up?

**Just write me a whatsapp message**.

I will put on the list!

The **deadline** is Monday 28th, afterwards I will opene the remaining spots to other people of the group who could not join the Milano trip.

**Just a few people have not confirmed yet...**

Do you really want to miss this next trip together?

Marco
