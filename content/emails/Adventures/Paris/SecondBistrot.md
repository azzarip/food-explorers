subject: "[6/10] The Second Bistrot of Petit Paris"
---

Dear Food Explorer, 

For decades, the word bistrot evoked a very specific image: a small, unpretentious restaurant where you could enjoy simple yet hearty dishes, often accompanied by a glass of wine.

If **our first bistrot was a nostalgic postcard** from old Paris: warm, intimate, and full of charm—this one feels like the next chapter.

For this day, I want to bring you to discover the “new waves” of the bistronomie. 

For Saturday lunch, we will go to what I call a **contemporary Bistrot**. 

A place where the soul of Parisian dining is just as alive, but a little more spontaneous, a touch more contemporary, and beautifully grounded in the everyday rhythm of the city.

It’s the kind of spot where locals come not out of tradition, but out of trust. 

Because they know today’s lunch will be just as satisfying as yesterday’s, and probably even better.

In the middle of the office area of Paris, a bit far from the usual Notre Dame or Montemartre.

## Welcome to the Second Place: A Parisian Bistrot in Motion

Walking into the feels like stepping back in time. 

The walls are adorned with murals depicting scenes of old Paris, adding to the bistro's charm.

**Despite the traditional look**, their menu offers **something completely different** from the traditional cuisine, you may expect.

The energy is a little more vibrant, the crowd a little younger, and the space a little more open. **Not showy or trendy—just quietly confident.**

Here, the dishes don’t try to tell a story of tradition, nor to be the cuisine of the grandmother. **They just taste amazing**.

Nothing fussy, nothing artificial. Just instinctive cooking, with flavor as the only rule.

And yes, you’ll want dessert. As I said already, you will get dessert that you want it or not.

The menu at is a testament to the **richness of French gastronomy**. 

With a focus on fresh, seasonal, and locally sourced ingredients, the dishes are both innovative and comforting.

Mains such as roasted lamb with rocket pesto and walnuts, or griddled beef with peppers, capers, and cherry tomatoes, offer a harmonious blend of flavors.

Here is a selection of photos I found online:

This bistrot offers an **amazing French contemporary cuisine** perfectly blended and stemming from tradition.

It is a place where only the Parisians go, probably because outside of the bustling streets of the city center, and because outside of the usual guides “The top 10 bistrot of Paris”.

I have tried many, many bistrot of Paris. And this place only brings French cuisine to life in a way I’ve never seen before. Each dish feels  like a perfect balance, in its simplicity.

## Why We’re Coming Here

Because if the first bistrot showed us where Paris has been, this one shows us where it still is.

Not stuck in time but living, breathing, and cooking for today.

We’ll sit among Parisians, eat what’s been cooked with care, and for a moment, we’ll be part of something deeply real.

And I can’t wait to share that moment with you.

À très bientôt,

Marco
