Hi {{ contact.first_name }},

Let me tell you something personal.  

If you’ve been reading my last emails, you may have noticed how much I talk about **bistrots**.  

There’s a reason for that.

I’ve been to many cities.  

Tasted incredible food. Seen breathtaking places. Shared unforgettable tables.  

But no place makes me feel **quite the way Paris does**.

And it’s not because of the Eiffel Tower or the Seine.  **It’s something deeper.**

## Why I Love Paris (And Why I Keep Coming Back)

It’s not just the food.  

It’s how food is treated: **with reverence, poetry, and love**.  

We all come from different countries—each with its own rich food culture.  

And yes, every city has something unique to offer.  

But **Paris has something extra**.  

It’s not the macarons, the croissants, or even the haute cuisine that draws me in.  

It’s the **bistrots**, in the most unassuming corners of the city.

### **The Bistrots Where Paris Still Breathes**  

Of course, some (most) bistrots have become **tourist traps**.

Serving the same tired dishes, living off their name alone.  

But there are others.  

**The hidden kitchens**, tucked away in quiet streets.  

Where chefs **still cook with passion**, where menus change daily, and every dish feels like a **love letter to the season**.  

These are the places I want to show you.

I decided to call it "Petit Paris" because I want to show this hidden corner of the city, not the big touristy brands.

## What Awaits You in Paris

To taste the **real stories** of the city, served on mismatched plates, with precious wine.  

To sit **elbow-to-elbow with locals**, in rooms filled with conversation and not just "frenchy" decoration.  

To experience how **modern French cuisine is being reborn**, one dish at a time.  

This isn’t a sightseeing trip.  

It’s a **celebration of flavor**, of culture, of the quiet artistry hiding in Paris' most charming corners.  

The way a chef **sharpens his knife** before creating a dish he may never repeat  

The **chalkboard menus** that change with the hour  

The **delicate dance** between deep tradition and bold innovation—alive in every bite  

In Paris, you eat to **feel something**. To understand. To remember.  

And that’s what I want for you.  

### Paris is not a checklist

We won’t visit the places on every *“Top 10”* list.  

We’ll go deeper—**down the rabbit hole**.

**Bistrots where young chefs are rewriting French cuisine**.  

Old kitchens being used for **new flavors**.  

This transformation is **still happening**. It’s **alive**, and we’ll be there to taste it.  

Tomorrow, I’ll show you the **last bistrot on our list**.  

Completely different from what we talked about in these last days.

This is not simply a trip. 

**In these three days**, I’ll show you the **past**, the **present**, and the **future** of Parisian bistrots.  

Let me take you there.  

🗓 **October 3–5, 2025**  

**Three days.** A lifetime of flavor and memories.

**Spots are limited.** Bookings open soon.

**À bientôt**,  
**Marco**
