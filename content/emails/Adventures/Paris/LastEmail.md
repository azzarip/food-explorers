Hi!

Our intimate Parisian food adventure is filling up fast, and I didn't want you to miss out on what might be the **most delicious weekend of your year**.

You already know what’s waiting for you if you come to Paris.

Paris isn’t just a city you visit.

It’s something you taste, feel, live.

And this weekend it could be yours.

We’re about to dive into the beating heart of French cuisine:

✨ Bistrot hopping, from hidden gems to time-honored classics.

✨ Long lunches where one glass of wine always turns into two.

✨ Experience the revelation of a wine pairing so perfect it makes conversation stop mid-sentence.

✨ And moments you’ll carry home, for any future travel to Paris.

Our journey takes us through hidden bistros to discover where the real french cuisine is cooked, to more hidden gem restaurants of new chefs trying to leave their impact. 

We'll taste dishes that have defined French cuisine for centuries and discover modern interpretations that are rewriting the rules.

This isn't just eating, it's **understanding a culture through its cuisine**. 

It's discovering why in Paris don't just eat to live; they live to cook and eat.

You will have the chance to taste desserts and pastry from the most renown _Patissiers_ of Paris.

Everything perfectly planned and **perfectly organized** to feel completely effortless.

If you enjoyed our trip to Milano, you are going to enjoy even more Paris.

## This is Why We Travel

To sit in a place like this, with people who love food like we do.

To **taste something new** and at the same time, deeply familiar.

To share a table, a laugh, a story, and to remember why we fell in love with Paris in the first place.

And I can’t wait to share it with you.

But here’s the thing:

I am not going to repeat this trip anytime soon. So now it is your time to choose.

Very soon, doors close. Seats are almost gone.

This last email.

**You deserve a weekend like this.**

## How to sign up?

**Just write me a whatsapp message**.

The **deadline** is Monday 28th, afterwards I will open the remaining spots to other people of the group who could not join the Milano trip.

**Just a few people have not confirmed yet...**

Do you really want to miss this next trip together?

Marco
