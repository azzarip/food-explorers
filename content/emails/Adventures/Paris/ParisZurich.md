Dear Food Explorer, 

Imagine strolling down cobblestone streets, where the scent of freshly baked croissants drifts through the air, and the warm glow of the vintage streets guides your path.

The sound of a lively accordion echoes from a charming café, and just ahead, a hidden bistrot awaits.

To truly immerse you in the world of Bistrots, I’ve organized an **exclusive dinner** where you can experience the essence of **Parisian dining** right here in Zurich.

# A Special Invite for you

If you dream of strolling through the cobbled streets of Montmartre, soaking in the romance of Paris with every bite and sip…

**For one exclusive night, the magic of Paris comes to Zurich!**

We will visit the **Bistrot Montmartre**, in Zurich Altstadt, near St. Peter’s Church, where you will embark on an unforgettable Parisian bistrot experience that will transport you straight to the heart of France. 

This enchanting bistrot is the little sister of the more famous the “Franzos”.

Just a few tables are available in this little restaurant nested between the buildings of the Old City of Zurich.

Here, every detail is steeped in nostalgia, from the dining hall decorated with silk and velvet, to the dish selection of the menu.

We will embark on an **unforgettable Bistrot tasting experience**, where silky soup, delicate beef tartare, and a showstopping coq au vin await you. 

All paired with hand-selected French wines that whisper stories of centuries-old vineyards. 


## This is a dinner meticulously crafted to whisk you away to Paris for one night. 

The ambiance, the flavors, it’s as if you stepped into a hidden bistrot tucked away in Montmartre, without ever leaving Zurich.

This is an **exclusive event for only you who joined our Milano Meraviglia Adventure**. 

Once the tables are filled, that’s it. No waiting list.
