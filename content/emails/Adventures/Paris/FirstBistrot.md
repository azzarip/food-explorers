subject: "[Paris] Our First Traditional Bistrot"

Dear Food Explorer, 

I can’t wait to take you here.

Of all the places on our Paris journey, **this is the one closest to my heart**. It’s where the magic began for me.

A dear friend of mine, once living in Paris, brought me here in 2018. 

Since then, every trip back to Paris **starts with this bistrot**. It’s become a ritual, a return to something timeless and deeply delicious.

## Welcome to the First Bistrot: a Time Capsule of Parisian Charm

Close your eyes for a second. Picture this:

Wooden tables slightly worn by time, soft yellow lighting, the subtle clinking of glasses, the aroma of sizzling butter and the people talking and cheering in front of a glass of wine.

The door creaks open under a hand-painted sign reading "_Bistrot à vin_" barely visible, a sort of **Chamber of Secrets** for only to those who truly know.

Though the current bistrot was founded in the late '90s, the walls have seen decades of joy, conversation, and culinary devotion, since they belonged to a previous restaurant before.

It's not just a place to eat—it’s a **Parisian story told through flavors**.

One of the **pioneers of the Bistronomie movement** I’ve told you about, this place is pure, honest, and refreshingly unpretentious.

No fancy flourishes. No showy presentations.

Just **classic French cuisine made with heart**, crafted daily from what the chef finds fresh at the market.

With its **vintage decor and intimate setting**, making it a favorite among locals seeking an authentic Parisian dining experience, not contaminated by the touristic traps.

A simple chalkboard leans against the bar, its handwritten menu revealing only what the chef has chosen for today. 

**No long lists**, no unnecessary flourishes, just a few carefully curated dishes, crafted from the freshest ingredients of the day.

## Expect Dishes that will suprise you

Not for their novelty, not for their overly artistic presentation, but for their essence, and simpleness.

I did not find picture of what I ate there last time, since the menu changes so fast...

The bistrot has its own clientele, and does not have a strong "social" presence, so it was really difficult to find high definition pictures of their dishes...

One of their musts: **bavette d'aloyau au poivre** (steak in pepper sauce).

But here you can see a selection of their dishes:

The restaurant offers always meat or fish selection, and each of them is amazing. They always source their fish and seafood fresh:

Not just the sweet end to the meal, but a celebration of everything French cuisine stands for.

The **desserts** will be included in the trip and you cannot miss on them!

That’s the beauty of this place: it’s all about surprise, spontaneity, and the freshest ingredients of the day. 

We will enjoy a meal crafted with the very essence of France, simple, yet amazing.

## This is Why We Travel

To sit in a place like this, with people who love food like we do.

To taste something new and at the same time, deeply familiar.

To share a table, a laugh, a story, and to remember why we fell in love with Paris in the first place.

And I can’t wait to share this trip with you.

À très bientôt,

Marco
