subject: "[2/10] Why Bistrots?"

Dear Food Explorer, 

Imagine strolling down cobblestone streets, where the scent of freshly baked croissants drifts through the air, and the warm glow of the vintage streets guides your path.

The sound of a lively accordion echoes from a charming café, and just ahead, a hidden bistrot awaits.

Petit Paris is **our next foodie adventure through parisian bistrots**, but why did I choose to go explore Parisian Bistrots?

**Paris is the European capital of Food**, and I say as an Italian! 

Every city in Europe has its own incredible cuisine, each with its own traditions and flavors.

But we all have to admit: no place has romanticized its connection to food, wine, and love quite like Paris.

This food adventure to Paris will be your chance to discover the French Cuisine as you never had the chance before!

The term **Bistrot** has a debated etymology but likely originates from the russian word _bystroh_ meaning fast, or quick.

One century ago, Bistrot where just quick and easy restaurants that served ready meals for the population, hence the name. 

Today, Bistrot is used to indicate a small restaurant with a few seats, in a cozy setting. 

In Paris, the word Bistrot means something more that just "cute restaurant"...

## Bistrot became extremely popular and famous at the beginning of the millenium, 20 years ago.

A famous food critic and author in the famous foodie magazine "_Le Fooding_", Sébastien Demorand, in 2004 conied the term "Bistronomie", as the portemanteau term of Bistot and Gastronomie.

With the aim of reconnecting cuisine to high-quality ingredients in a relaxed, informal setting, a new movement emerged in the early 1990s:
the Bistronomie.

Only now in these days the Bistronomie has reached its peak, after decade of experimentation from the chefs.

The Bistrot that was once just a small, casual eatery with a few seats transformed into the temple of a newly created artistic culinary style.

And still today the chefs bring new ideas and new creation and keep evolving their style.

Bistronomie and modern Bistrots are about authenticity and accessibility—offering fine flavors without the formality and rituals of the haute cuisine.

**This is what Petit Paris will be.**

 An exploration and an adventure into the world of Parisians bistrots and the french bistronomie.

## During our trip we will explore three types of Bistrots

The bistrots that opened in the 90s are different, completely different from the Bistrots that opened in the last recent years.

In the 3 days of this weekend in Paris, I have designed each day around its own theme, creating a journey that not only highlights the diversity of Parisian dining but also helps us navigate and fully immerse ourselves in this french culinary adventure together.

### Friday: Tradition

We will kick off our holiday with a step back in time as I take you to one of most iconic bistrot, where classic French flavors reign supreme.

There you will find the most typical dishes that you expect from the French cuisine.

This bistrot captures the essence of the early Bistronomie movement like no other.

No unnecessary embellishments, no overcomplicated presentations. Just honest, beautifully executed cooking that lets the
ingredients shine.

### Saturday lunch

For this day, I want to bring you to discover the “_new waves_” of the bistronomie. 

On Friday we tasted the most classical Bistrot cuisine. Today **for lunch we go to some more contemporary take** of
Bistronomie.

It is no easy task to describe a restaurant and its style, without just describing their dishes.

But the menu changes so fast and so often that talking about the dishes makes almost no sense.

In this second bistrot, despite the traditional look, their menu offers something completely different from the traditional cuisine.

**The menu at is a testament to the richness of Parisian cuisine**. 

With a focus on fresh, seasonal, and locally sourced ingredients, the dishes are both innovative but still with their own character.

### Saturday Dinner

The birth of bistronomie reshaped completely the Parisian dining scene, shifting the focus from formal dining to more accessible, flavor-driven experiences.

Fast forward to today, and we see a new trend emerging: the **neo-bistrot**.

These modern dining spaces take inspiration from both traditional bistrot culture and contemporary gastronomy, with fusion elements
taken from other cuisines, even outside of France.

Unlike classic fine dining establishments with their white tablecloths and silver cutlery, neo-bistrots embrace a more welcoming
atmosphere.

This means open kitchens, minimalist décor, and an effortless blend of elegance and informality.

Neo-bistrots are run by chefs who often have collected experience in Michelin starred restaurants but choose to cook with greater freedom. 

Or by chefs who collected experiences in other countries and decided to bring this new influxes into their cooking style.

Saturday evening will be dedicated to these neo-bistrot to taste how the culture and food of these culinary movement has changed over the years.

### Sunday

For Sunday lunch we are not going to a Bistrot, but I have a special surpise for that day, and I will talk about it on a future email.

For today's email I hope it's enough!

See you soon,

Marco
