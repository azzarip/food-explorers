subject: You Don’t Need the Omakase to Join Milano
---

Hi!

Just a quick message to clarify something important.

## You don’t need to join the Omakase to be part of the Marvelous Milano adventure

The Omakase is only one **optional moment** inside the weekend,
a special experience for 6 people.

But the full 3-day adventure from April 17–19, 2026 is open to everyone.

We’ll explore the Milano that most people never taste.

Whether you choose the Omakase or not, the weekend itself is something truly special.

This is the last email, then I'm going to close the priority list.
