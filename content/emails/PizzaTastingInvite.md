**A Trattoria e Pullicinella** is the latest creation by one of the city’s most celebrated pizzaiolo: **Raffaele Tromiro**.

He is the man behind Napulé, one of the city (and canton) most successfull and appreciated pizzeria.

This is not just dinner, it’s a journey into the heart of true pizza craftsmanship.

If you have been to one of our tasting, you will have the chance to taste almost the full menu, with some special recipes.

**What's different from other pizzeria?**

Raffaele decided to open this new pizzeria with the idea to bring new and **modern neapolitan pizza** and new special tastes you will not see anywhere.

**Spots are limited**, reserve yours now and be part of something deliciously unforgettable.

Hope to see you there,

Marco
