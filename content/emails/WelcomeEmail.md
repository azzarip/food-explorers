Dear Foodie, 

## It is a great pleasure to **welcome you to our community**! üéâ

We are a **passionate group** of **food lovers** based in Z√ºrich and the surrounding areas, and every week we explore exciting *new restaurants*, *bars*, and other *culinary gems* together. 

Whether you're a local or visiting, you're now part of an exclusive club of people who enjoy discovering the best of what **food culture** has to offer!


## Your next Food Event Options

We offer two unique event types, both designed to provide a laid-back and enjoyable dining experience:

### √Å la carte

This is the **simplest and most recurring** type of event. Here's how it works:

1. We gather at a selected restaurant or venue.

2. You choose and order whatever you like from the menu.

3. You pay for what you order, and enjoy a relaxed, fun dining experience with fellow food explorers.

You order what you like and pay for what you ordered. No prepayment need, no credit card reservation. 

You reserve via our website and you simply show up there. **We will reserve a seat for you.**

### Tasting Menu

In this type of event, we dive deeper into the experience by exploring a specific culture or culinary tradition.

Our expert organizers curate a **special tasting menu**, which could include a specially **arranged menu** or a **selection of dishes** that reflect the venue‚Äôs specialty.

The Menu is fixed and published before, and usually there is a presale to join this event.

Examples are: Japanese Omakase, Italian's Tavolata, Pizza Tasting or other Authentic Culinary Experiences...

## How do you book?

Every time a new event is published you will **receive an email** with all the details you need. 

Each event will have the **menu published**, so you can check it before booking your spot.

You will have **two buttons**: "_I want to come_" and "_I am not interested_". 

And simply select one of those.

Also you can check the previously published events here:

## A Little Reminder

Please remember to **cancel your participation** if you are unable to attend! 

We reserve a place specifically for you, and last-minute no-shows are a challenge for us and the venues we work with. 

We take great pride in curating the **most amazing events** for you. And we do it for free.

Therefore we only invite people who are committed and respect our works. Recurring no-shows could lead to being placed on our blacklist.

So, please make sure you‚Äôre available before booking your spot, and if something comes up, kindly let us know as soon as possible. 

## You Are The Most Welcome

New events are published every week, and **we would love to have you** join us!

When you join us, you're not just coming to an event ‚Äì you're stepping into a world of new friendships and unforgettable memories. 

We‚Äôre a **group of passionate food lovers**, all waiting to welcome you with open arms. 

It‚Äôs about more than just food; it's about **sharing joy**, laughter, and the simple pleasure of discovering something new together. 

We are people from all around the world, and each person is eager to meet and greet new friends living in the same city.
