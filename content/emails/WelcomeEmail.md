Dear Foodie, 

### It is a great pleasure to **welcome you to our community**! üéâ

We are a **passionate group** of **food lovers** based in Z√ºrich and the surrounding areas, and every week we explore exciting *new restaurants*, *bars*, and other *culinary gems* together. 

Whether you're a local or visiting, you're now part of an exclusive club of people who enjoy discovering the best of what **food culture** has to offer!


## We organize two main types of events: _√Å la carte_ dinners and __Tasting Menu__ dinners.

### √Å la carte

This is the **simplest and most recurring** type of event. Here's how it works:

- We gather at a selected restaurant or venue.
- You choose and order whatever you like from the menu.
- You pay for what you order, and enjoy a relaxed, fun dining experience with fellow food explorers.

You order what you like and pay for what you ordered. No prepayment need, no credit card reservation. 

You reserve via our website and you simply show up there. **We will reserve a seat for you.**

### Tasting Menu

In this type of event, we dive deeper into the experience by exploring a specific culture or culinary tradition.

Our expert organizers curate a **special tasting menu**, which could include a specially **arranged menu** or a **selection of dishes** that reflect the venue‚Äôs specialty.

The Menu is fixed and published before, and usually there is a presale to join this event.

Examples are: Japanese Omakase, Italian's Tavolata, Pizza Tasting and Chinese Tasting...

## How do I book?

Every time a new event is published you will **receive an email**. 

You will have **all the info to choose** if is the restaurant you like or not.

Each event will have the **menu published**, so you can check it before booking your spot.

You will **two buttons**: "_I want to come_" and "_I am not interested_". 

And simply select one of those.

## One Word of Attention

Please remember to **cancel your participation** if you are unable to attend. We reserve a place specifically for you, and last-minute no-shows are a challenge for us and the venues we work with. 

We take great pride in curating the **most amazing events** for you. We realize that you may have an unexpected problems and there are always a few hiccups along the way. 

However, recurring no-shows could lead to being placed on our blacklist to ensure to ensure we only invite people who are committed and respect the integrity of our events.

So, please make sure you‚Äôre available before booking your spot, and if something comes up, kindly let us know as soon as possible. We want to ensure that every event is enjoyable and well-attended!
