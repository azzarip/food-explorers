        <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-serif">Dear Wine Lover,</p>
        <p>How many times did you found out <strong>too late</strong> about an incredible wine event?</p>
        <p>Or, how often do you forget about that new tasting in Zurich?</p>
        <p>... <em>if only I had known</em>...</p>
        <p class="font-semibold">That ends today.</p>
        <p>Because I‚Äôm about to hand you something no one else in Z√ºrich has ever put together before:</p>
        <div class="text-center px-12 font-bold text-2xl leading-relaxed">
            üëâ The only complete insider calendar of every single wine tasting happening in Z√ºrich ‚Äî delivered straight to your inbox, before the corks are even pulled.
        </div>
        <p>‚ùå No searching.</p>
        <p>‚ùå No remembering.</p>
        <p>‚ùå No relying on your calendar.</p>
        <p>With the <strong>Zurich Wine Compass</strong>, you‚Äôll always know when and where the next tasting is happening ‚Äî and you‚Äôll never miss any bottle again.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 font-bold lg:text-3xl">Let's be honest...</h2>
        <p>Zurich is full of wine tastings, but often they are hidden on wine shop websites.</p>
        <p>Or buried in mailing lists.</p>
        <p>You have to spend hours hunting, looking at emails nobody reads, and often you hear about them <em>only after</em> they happened.</p>

        <p>This is why <strong>most wine lovers</strong> in Zurich end up missing the best events.</p>
        <p>Many people just end up going to the most famous ones, just because they are the most advertised...</p>
        <p>...you know, no? the one on the boats...</p>
        <p>By the time people hear of a certain event, the spots are gone or the date has passed. </p>
        <p>The corks are pulled. The magic is over.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl  lg:text-2xl text-center">The Zurich Wine Compass</h2>
        <p>Zurich Wine Compass is your <strong>weekly email</strong> that informs you about all the upcoming events in the city.</p>
        <p>No Bern. No Basel. No random city 2 hours of train away.</p>
        <p>Only Zurich and its close surroundings.</p>
        <p>That‚Äôs exactly what you get with the Zurich Wine Compass.</p>
        <p>Here‚Äôs what it means for you:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2">
            <li>üç∑ <strong>Every tasting in one place</strong> ‚Äî no more endless scrolling, searching, or asking around.</li>
            <li>ü•Ç <strong>Weekly delivery</strong> ‚Äî always on time, always up-to-date.</li>
            <li>üçá <strong>Stay one glass ahead</strong> ‚Äî you‚Äôll hear before the seats are gone.</li>
            <li>üóìÔ∏è <strong>Never miss the good ones</strong> ‚Äî from hidden gems to major events.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All curated. All simplified. All for you.</p>
