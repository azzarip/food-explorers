            <p>If you are reading these words, it means you care and like the events I have been organizing in the past
                years.</p>
            <p class="font-semibold">I am organizing a special weekend in <strong>the most famous European
                    Capital for Food</strong>, from Friday to Sunday, in October.</p>
            <p>The exact date will be decided soon.</p>
            <p>Each day we will try different things, visit restaurants and bars, while in the mean time we will explore
                the city and its hidden gems.</p>
            <p>It will be my greatest care in <span class="bg-amber-300/50">organizing the most delightful holiday a
                    foodie like you can aspire for</span>.</p>
        


        <h2 class="pt-6 font-trajan text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold text-center" id="plan">The Plan</h2>
        <p>In this weekend, <strong>we will explore different restaurant of Paris</strong>, each carefully selected to
            showcase the heart and soul of Parisian cuisine.</p>
        <p>Along the way, we‚Äôll also visit some special food stops that will surprise and delight you, from hidden
            patisseries to secret boulangeries filled with local treasures.</p>
        <p>We will arrive on Friday around 12:00, we put down our luggages in the hotel and we head to the first
            restaurant.</p>
        <p><strong>Your only responability is</strong> to come to Paris on Friday on time. From when you reach the
            Hotel, I will be there taking care of you.</p>
        <p>I have designed each day around its own theme, creating a journey that
            not only highlights the diversity of Parisian dining but also helps
            us navigate and fully immerse ourselves in this <strong> french culinary
                adventure together</strong>.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôve chosen to organize our three days around three distinct themes, which are:</p>
        <ul class="text-2xl font-semibold list-disc list-inside font-head">
            <li>Day 1: <span class="text-red-700">Paris Tradition</span><br>
                <p class="font-normal text-lg my-2">Step back in time as we take you to one of most iconic bistrot,
                    where
                    classic French flavors reign supreme.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Day 2: <span class="text-cyan-800">Neo-Paris</span> <br>
                <p class="font-normal text-lg my-2">Experience the new wave of Parisian cuisine, where bold chefs
                    reinvent tradition with a touch of modernity</p>

            </li>
            <li>Day 3: <span class="text-pink-700">Hidden Gem</span><br>
                <p class="font-normal text-lg my-2">On Sunday something special awaits for you: a Bistrot? Maybe‚Ä¶ I will
                    bring you to a restaurant known only to locals, where the chef, a oneof-a-kind person, will lead us
                    through unmarked territory‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>It's not Paris trip without <strong>fine dining</strong>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="h2 ml-2">What will be included</h2>
        <div class="px-4 rounded-lg">
            <h2 class="mt-6 mb-2 font-serif text-2xl text-center">Hotel</h2>
            <p>To have the greatest experience in Paris we will sleep in one of the hotel of the city center.</p>
            <p>It will be a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4-star) Hotel, so I can assure you are well threated and well rested.</p>
            <p><strong>Each participant will have its own room. </strong> You will not share your private space with anyone else.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="px-4 rounded-lg">
            <h2 class="my-6 font-serif text-2xl text-center">Restaurants</h2>
            <p>Most of Parisian menus are made of three dishes: Entr√©e, Plat and Dessert. These three dishes are included.</p>
            <p>Dishes will be yours to choose from the Menu.</p>
        </div>

            <p>My suggestion is the train, but also the plane is a viable option.</p>
            <p>In the city, you can move around by public transport or Uber/Taxi.</p>

            <p>I will leave the drinks out, to make it fairer for people who don't drink alcohol or drink just a bit.</p>
            <p>For the wine, we can share the bottles among who wants.</p>

            <p><strong>The final price is not yet decided.</strong> It will be comunicated in 2-3 weeks, as soon as I finish
                organizing.</p>
            <p>You will have the hotel, all the restaurant included, and all the organization costs included.</p>
            <p>So you can simply relax and enjoy the city.</p>
