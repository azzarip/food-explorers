            <p>Paris is more than just a city; it‚Äôs a <strong>culinary legend</strong>.</p>
            <p>And as an Italian who breathes good food, I can tell you: no place in Europe weaves history, passion, and
                flavor into everyday life quite like Paris.</p>
            <p>You may have been there, probably many times...</p>
            <p>But this time, you're invited to step behind the scenes into a Paris that <strong>only locals know</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>I want to make it really clear...</p>

            <p>It‚Äôs a <strong>deep dive</strong> into the real Parisian Cuisine, curated for those who crave authenticity,
                the real experience, and discovering the <strong>hidden gems</strong> of the city.</p>
            <p></p>

            </div>

            <h3 class="font-semibold font-head text-2xl lg:text-3xl">1. ‚ú®Fine Dining ‚ú®</h3>
            <p>Paris holds the crown as the <strong>Michelin-starred capital of Europe</strong>, and its fine dining scene
                is nothing short of breathtaking.</p>
            <p>It is second only to Tokyo!</p>
            <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/e3/d1/28/maigre-confit-a-l-huile.jpg?w=1200&h=800&s=1" alt="Fine Dining Pictures" class="rounded shadow lg:w-1/2 mx-auto">
            <p>Fine dining isn‚Äôt just about elegance; it‚Äôs about crafting a once-in-a-lifetime experience: where taste,
                storytelling, and imagination come together.</p>
            <p>We‚Äôll experience a restaurant that <span class="font-bold">left me speechless</span>, a
                place where the philosophy behind the food is as rich as the flavors on your plate.</p>


            <h3 class="font-semibold font-head text-2xl lg:text-3xl">2. The Desserts ü•êüç∞</h3>
            <p>No journey to Paris would be really worthy without surrendering to the city's most tempting pleasure:
                <strong>desserts</strong>.</p>
            <p>In its <strong>boulangeries</strong> and <strong>patisseries</strong>; butter, sugar, and magic come together
                in creations that are almost too beautiful to eat, almost.</p>
            <img src="https://horecanews.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dolci-bachour.jpg" alt="Paris Desserts" class="shadow rounded">
            <p>But this isn‚Äôt just about sugar and butter: it‚Äôs about passion, craft, and a legacy that has shaped the world‚Äôs view of pastry-making. </p>
            <p>You cannot skip dessert in Paris, it is <strong>morally wrong</strong> not to eat them.</p>
            <p>In Paris, desserts aren‚Äôt just sweet to finish the dinner, they are an integral part of the meal, a <strong>delightful experience</strong>, a moment of pure joy in every bite.
            </p>
            <img src="https://media.scoolinary.app/images/2023/07/294_Bachour_banner2.jpg" alt="Paris boulangerie" class="shadow rounded">
            <p>In the morning, we can visit the boulangeries (<em>bakeries</em> in english), to taste the freshly made croissants, and other creations.</p>
            

            <h3 class="font-semibold font-head text-2xl lg:text-3xl">3. The Bistrots üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥</h3>
            <p>In Paris, food is an experience that goes beyond the food, it‚Äôs woven into the city‚Äôs soul and culture.</p>
            <p>You‚Äôll hear words like <em>haute cuisine</em>, <em>bistrots</em>, and <em>brasseries</em> everywhere, but
                here, they mean so much more.</p>
        
            <p>The <strong>bistrot</strong> in the last years have been becoming more and more important, from a gastronomical point of view.</p>
            <img src="@image('cozy_bistrot.webp')" alt="Cozy Bistrot Picture" class="rounded shadow">
            <p></p>
            <p>It‚Äôs where simple ingredients are transformed into dishes that taste like home and hospitality.</p>
            <p class="font-semibold">During our journey, we'll dine in bistrots, where you can feel the every day life Paris
                of around you.</p>

                <p>I outlined a plan for these days, but apart from lunch and dinners you have all the free time for yourself to
                    explore the city and visit what you like the most.</p>
                <p class="font-semibold">Do not worry, you are not stuck with me for 3 days straight.</p>

            <div class="mt-6">
                <h3 class="mt-6 mb-4 font-serif text-2xl font-semiboldl">I have allergies or intollerances...</h3>
                <p>Before booking, I will ask any participant for allergies or intollerances.</p>
                <p>This information will be kept private and only shared with the restaurant staff.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-6">
                <h3 class="mt-6 mb-4 font-serif text-2xl font-semiboldl">Are there vegetarian options?</h3>
                <p>As I complete the organization I can tell you better.</p>
                <p>Most of the restaurants I am in contact with offer vegetarian dishes.</p>
                <p>If you join the waitlist, you can maybe tell me by message or email, so I know for sure.</p>
                <p>Anyhow I will ask during booking what are your dietary restrictions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-6">
                <h3 class="mt-6 mb-4 font-serif text-2xl font-semiboldl">Any other question?</h3>
                <p>Contact me at <a href="mailto:marco.azzari@foodexplorers.ch">marco.azzari@foodexplorers.ch</a>.</p>
                <p>I will be happy to reply.</p>

            <p>Just a heads-up: the pictures are for illustration only, the actual dishes might be different, since menu and restaurant can change.</p>
