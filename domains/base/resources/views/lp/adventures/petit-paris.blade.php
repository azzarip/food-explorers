                before!</p>

            <p class="font-serif text-xl text-center"> The word "<strong>petit</strong> " means “<em>little</em>” in French.
            </p>

            <p>France, and especially Paris has been the capital of Haute Cuisine.</p>

            <p>The term "<strong>haute cuisine</strong>" doesn't just refer to high-end restaurants but also to the entire
                experience: refined techniques, artful presentations, and
                meticulously structured meals served in exclusive, aristocratic settings.</p>

            <p>Today, this style of dining has been pushed to the extreme by Michelin-starred restaurants.</p>

            <p>In Paris, it’s easy to find places where a <strong>single meal costs hundreds of euros</strong>, lasts five
                hours, and unfolds in an atmosphere of utmost
                formality. But that’s not the Paris I love.</p>

            <p>I called this adventure Petit Paris because I want to help you discover the “smaller” cuisine—less
                aristocratic, but no less delicious or
                important.</p>

            <h2 class="my-6 font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-center">The Cuisine of Bistrots</h2>

            <p>For the purest french food lovers, also called <strong>Bistronomie</strong>.</p>

            <p>But let's explore together: what is a Bistrot?</p>

            <p>The word <em>Bistrot</em> is used all over Europe to indicate a <strong>small restaurant with a few seats, in
                    a cozy setting</strong>.</p>

            <p>Is it the same in Paris? Yes, but is also something more.</p>

            <p>In France, a bistrot is where people come together to share a meal, a conversation, and a moment of their
                day.</p>

            <p class="p-4 text-xl border-2 border-amber-700 rounded-lg"><strong>It’s not about aristocratic dining or
                    extravagant dishes;</strong> it’s about simplicity,
                quality, and atmosphere. A true bistrot is warm, unpretentious, and
                deeply rooted in daily life.</p>

            <p>The pace is relaxed yet lively, with the comforting clatter of cutlery, the
                low hum of conversations, and the occasional laughter from a nearby
                table.</p>

            <p><strong>Regulars greet the owner by name</strong>, and the waiters move effortlessly between tables closely
                packed between each other.</p>

            <p>Old wooden furniture, small chair and some white tableclothes are the only decorations. Maybe opened bottles
                of wine collected through the years…</p>

            <p class="font-semibold">What matters most is that the food is simple, flavorful, and deeply satisfying</p>

            <p>The menu is often handwritten on a chalkboard, changing daily based on what’s fresh and in season.</p>

            <p>In Paris, a bistrot is a place where life happens. It’s where friends catch up over a glass of wine, where
                colleagues take a long lunch, and where strangers sit side by side at small wooden tables, exchanging a
                polite
                bonjour before focusing on their meal.</p>

            <p> <strong> A bistrot is not designed to impress</strong>; it’s
                designed to make you feel at home, whether you’re a local or a
                visitor.</p>

            <p> And once you’ve experienced it, you’ll understand why the
                French cherish it so much</p>

            <p>That is also why I called this trip Petit Paris, I will bring you <strong>into the
                    heart of the city</strong>, not just as a tourist, but to experience the more
                daily life and daily food of Paris like the Parisians do.</p>

            <h2 class="my-6 font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-center">Bistrot Menus</h2>


            <p class="font-semibold">A bistrot menu is not a book with endless pages of choices.</p>

            <p>Often it does not even exist in printed version. A bistrot embraces
                spontaneity and freshness, crafting dishes based on what’s best at the
                market that day.</p>

            <p>A traditional French bistrot meal follows a simple structure: Entrée, Plat, and Dessert.</p>

            <h3 class="font-serif font-semibold text-center p-4 bg-amber-300/20">Entrée</h3>
            <p>The entrée is the starter, usually something light but full of character.</p>
            <p>Not to be confused with the American "Entrée" which means main course.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h3 class="font-serif font-semibold text-center p-4 bg-red-300/20">Plat</h3>
            <p>Then comes the plat, the main course, where the heart of the bistrot’s
                cooking shines.</p>
            <p> Here you get your meat, your fish or whatever else you ordered.</p>


            <h3 class="font-serif font-semibold text-center p-4 bg-cyan-500/20">Dessert</h3>
            <p>Finally, the dessert, which the French treat with just as much respect
                as the rest of the meal. .</p>
            <p> Usually bistrot won’t serve extravagant, modern creations—desserts here are classics, perfected over
                generations.</p>

            <p class="font-serif font-semibold text-2xl text-center p-4 border-2 border-red-800 rounded-lg">
                Desserts are included!
            </p>

            <p>Not only they are included, but they are mandatory. If you don’t
                have dessert in Paris, I am ashamed of you.</p>

            <p>So in each of the restaurant you will get these three dishes, you will
                choose your own preferred dish from the menu that the restaurant will
                hand in that day.</p>

            <h2 class="my-6 font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-center underline decoration-4  decoration-blue-700">There
                are no Menus</h2>
            <p>This trip is all about exploring the most characteristics Bistrots of Paris.</p>
            <p>And as you might know, a Bistrot is a really small restaurant, <strong>their menu
                    changes frequently - sometimes weekly, if not daily</strong>.</p>
            <p>That is the beauty of these places: fresh ingredient, new recipes that
                reflect the season and the chef ’s inspiration for the day.</p>

            <p class="font-semibold">Because of this, there’s no fixed menu for our trip.</p>

            <p>However, to give you a sense of what to expect, I’ve included some
                past menus from these bistrots, along with a few photos I found
                online.</p>

            <p>These will give you an idea of their style, philosophy, and signature
                dishes, but the exact menu we’ll enjoy might be different.</p>

            <p>That’s part of the <span class="font-semibold text-green-900">adventure</span>!</p>

            <p>Rather than focusing on a set list of
                dishes, <strong>I’ve carefully selected each bistrot based on its quality,
                    atmosphere, and culinary creativity</strong>.</p>

            <p>In each of the Bistrot, you will have included the three dishes they
                offer, the combination of Entrée, Plat, and Dessert for one person.</p>

            <p>So, while I can’t hand you a precise menu in advance, the restaurants
                have told me they are usually really open to do changes and adapt to
                your dietary style.</p>

            <p>You will always find a fish dish, a meat dish and a vegetarian (often with cheese) dish.</p>



            <h2 class="pt-6 font-trajan text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold text-center" id="plan">The Plan</h2>
            <p>In this weekend, <strong>we will explore three different bistrots</strong>, each carefully selected to
                showcase the heart
                and soul of Parisian cuisine.</p>
            <p>Along the way, we’ll also visit some special food stops that will surprise and delight you, from hidden
                patisseries to bustling streets foods filled with local treasures.</p>
            <p>We will arrive on Friday for 12:00, we put down our luggages in the hotel and we head to the first
                restaurant.</p>
            <p><strong>Your only responability is</strong> to come to Paris on Friday on time. From when you reach the
                Hotel, I will be there taking care of you.</p>
            <p>I have designed each day around its own theme, creating a journey that
                not only highlights the diversity of Parisian dining but also helps
                us navigate and fully immerse ourselves in this <strong> french culinary
                    adventure together</strong>.</p>
            <p>I’ve chosen to organize our three days around three distinct themes, which are:</p>
            <ul class="text-2xl font-semibold list-disc list-inside font-head">
                <li>Day 1: <span class="text-red-700">Paris Tradition</span><br>
                    <p class="font-normal text-lg">Step back in time as we take you to one of most iconic bistrot, where
                        classic French flavors reign supreme.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Day 2: <span class="text-cyan-800">Modern Marvels</span> <br>
                    <p class="font-normal text-lg">Experience the new wave of Parisian cuisine, where bold chefs
                        reinvent tradition with a touch of modernity</p>

                </li>
                <li>Day 3: <span class="text-pink-700">Hidden Gem</span><br>
                    <p class="font-normal text-lg">On Sunday something special awaits for you: a Bistrot? Maybe… I will
                        bring you to a restaurant known only to locals, where the chef, a oneof-a-kind person, will lead us
                        through unmarked territory…</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        {{-- <div class="p-2 mt-12 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class=" font-serif text-3xl text-center font-semibold">Paris Tradition </h3>
            <p class="font-serif mb-6 text-2xl text-center">Day 1</p>
            <div class="space-y-4 ">
                <p>We will start the day at 12:00 at the Hotel.</p>
                <p>From there we walk towards the quartiere <strong>Garibaldi</strong> where today lies the food zone of
                    Milano.</p>

                <h4 class="font-serif text-2xl text-center">Cucina Meneghina</h4>
                <p>Cucina Meneghina refers to the traditional cuisine of Milan, the capital of the Lombardy region in
                    northern Italy. The term "Meneghina" derives from the Milanese dialect and is often used to describe
                    something distinctly Milanese.</p>
                <p>This cuisine is the most varied in Italy, shaped by its rich history and its neighbors. </p>
                <p>After some antipasti to warm us up we will try the Risotto alla Milanese.</p>
                <p>We will taste <em>Risotto Milanese</em> and other really typical dishes.</p>
                <p> I will bring you to one of the most ancient and most reknown restaurant of the city. With the true
                    italian flavors.</p>

                <img src="https://cdn.chefincamicia.com/images/d72fbbccd9fe64c3a14f85d225a046f4.1920.jpg"
                    alt="Risotto Alla Milanese" class="rounded-lg shadow-lg">
                <p>But don’t be mistaken: <strong>risotto isn’t just “rice with cheese”</strong>.</p>
                <p> It’s a specific variety of rice, cooked al dente, creating a <strong>creamy texture</strong> when
                    combined with butter and cheese. </p>
                <p>A good risotto has a <strong>velvety smooth texture</strong>, where the grains of rice are still
                    distinct, adding both flavor and texture to the dish.</p>
                <p>The risotto is <strong>infused with saffron</strong>, which not only imparts a rich flavor but also
                    gives
                    the dish its iconic golden hue.</p>
                <p>Today, Risotto alla Milanese has become the <strong>culinary symbol of Milan</strong>.</p>
                <p>As with any popular dish, Risotto alla Milanese has its share of imitations. In Milan, you’ll often
                    find
                    overpriced yellow rice passed off as the real thing. </p>
                <p>But do not worry, I carefully selected each restaurant we go, so I can ensure you have the best
                    experience and the most iconic and unaltered food.</p>

                <h4 class="font-serif text-xl">Ossobuco alla Milanese</h4>
                <p> The rice is served with a piece of veal Meat called Ossobuco, on the side of the risotto. </p>
                <p>If you tried the Ossobuco outside of Italy, you haven't tried the real thing, nor anything that comes
                    close. </p>
                <p>You'll experience this dish as it should be: rich, savory, and perfectly complementing the creamy
                    risotto.</p>
                <p>Ossobuco literally means "<i>bone with a hole</i>", referring to a specific cut of veal, with the
                    bone
                    marrow at its center.
                </p>

                            mid-1800s, renowned for its single, iconic product—a beloved mid-afternoon snack loved and

                <p>We will meet again before dinner to immerse ourselves in the delightful Milanese tradition of
                    <b>Apericena</b>.
                </p>
                <p>This unique Italian dining concept beautifully combines the essence of an aperitivo (a pre-dinner
                    drink
                    with light snacks, aperitif or apero) with the satisfying elements of a light dinner (cena). </p>
                <p><b>Apericena</b> is more than just a meal—it’s a relaxed and social experience, typically enjoyed in
                    the
                    early evening. In April, with the sun setting around 8 PM, this is the perfect time to unwind and
                    savor
                    the flavors of Milan while basking in the warm glow of twilight. </p>
                <p>To make the experience truly special, <b>we’ll enjoy our apericena on a stunning rooftop terrace</b>,
                    offering breathtaking views of Milan’s skyline. </p>

                <p>Milano is a city that never truly sleeps— or better sleeps later than Zurich! It’s still lively until
                    2
                    am, especially on weekends.</p>
                <p>While many of the rooftop terraces close around 10 or 11 pm, <b> the day doesn’t have to end
                        there</b>.

                <p>
                    If you’re up for it, we can continue the night by heading to a trendy mixology bar or an exclusive
                    venue.</p>
                <p>I will leave this option totally open, but I will ask around if you are interested in some

                makes this adventure so special.
            <p>That said, you already have the menus, so you know exactly what we’ll be enjoying. </p>

                <h4 class="font-serif text-xl">The Fish Where There Is No Sea</h4>
                <p>When you think of Milan, the iconic cathedral, and towering skyscrapers might spring to mind. </p>
                <p>Yet, many are unaware that, <strong>Milan boasts Italy's largest and best-supplied fish
                        market</strong>, located just a couple of kilometers from the city center. </p>
                <p>Each day at the market opens its door at 4 am, and these <strong>treasures of the sea</strong> are
                    ready for the restaurant owners and chefs to bring to their cuisine and start the day.</p>
                <p>The fish that arrives in Milan undergoes rigorous quality control. Veterinarians and laboratories are
                    on-site to ensure that every product meets the highest standards.</p>
                <p class="font-semibold">Milan’s culinary scene is unparalleled, and its fish cuisine is no exception.
                </p>
                <p> <strong>The city attracts the best chefs</strong>, hospitality and culinary talent in Italy. Over
                    the years, this has fostered a vibrant seafood tradition, even in a city so far away from the coast.
                </p>
                <p>The combination of exceptional ingredients and world-class chefs has elevated Milan’s fish cuisine to
                    new heights. </p>
                <p>Milan offers seafood experiences that rival and even outclass those of coastal towns.</p>
                <p>That’s why, during our weekend, I’m selecting one of the finest restaurants for one of our dinners,
                    so we can end the day with delicious, exquisite food.</p>
                <h4 class="font-serif text-xl">Italian Tradition</h4>
                <p>In Italy, it’s customary to start with small dishes of raw, cold, and hot appetizers—bite-sized, much
                    like Spanish tapas—before moving on to a main course such as pasta. </p>
                <p>I will make you try different typical entries of the Italian tradition, from the Rossi di Mazara, the
                    most delicious shrimp of the Mediterrenean, the Octopus and other delicacies.</p>
                <p>One dish I highly recommend is <strong>Pasta con l’Astice, the European lobster</strong>. </p>
                <p>Lobster demand the freshest ingredients to truly shine. In Milan, thanks to the meticulous sourcing
                    at the fish market, you can be assured of unparalleled quality—fresh, never frozen.</p>
                <p>The finest restaurants, take the time to present a perfectly prepared lobster, with the shell opened
                    and the meat beautifully displayed—so you can enjoy the dish without the struggle or mess of
                    handling the shell.</p>
                <p><strong>This is no simple pasta with shrimps</strong>. There is no fish or shellfish that matches the
                    complexity of flavors and aroma found in this dish.</p>

                <h4 class="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold">The Chef: A Culinary Innovator</h4>
                <p>This chef is not simply another chef or culinary artist, there are many.</p>
                <p>His charisma and enthusiasm will undoubtedly leave an impression, just as his food will.</p>
                <p>I will try to introduce you to him in person during our dinner.</p>
                <p>His passion is contagious, and his storytelling adds a whole new dimension to dining. </p>
                <p class="font-semibold">He doesn't just serve dishes; he presents stories, sometimes even cooking
                    directly at the table for his guests.</p>

                    artichokes, asparagus, and other spring delicacies that promise to surprise your palate.</p>

                <h4 class="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold">The Star of the Show</h4>
                <p>In central Italy, pasta is the undisputed king of the table, and the chef's take on carbonara is
                    legendary.</p>
                <p>Forget everything you think you know about this dish.
                </p>
                <p>This isn't the overdone version you might associate with cheap imitations. This is the <strong>real
                        deal—crafted with precision, passion, and skills</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>Yes, carbonara has been the subject of many jokes and memes, but trust me: when done right,
                    <strong>it's pure magic</strong>. For once in your life, you'll taste a carbonara that sets the gold
                    standard.
                </p>
                <p>If you think something like: "<em>I don't like pasta with bacon...</em>" this is not what carbonara
                    is...
                </p>
                <p>A real carbonara is the cross point between a good cured meat (guanciale), with a fine ripe sheep
                    cheese and the strength of egg yolks.Carbonara is not pasta with bacon, it is a magical interplay
                    between these 3 ingredients.
                </p>
                <p>This restaurant remains is a <strong>great celebration of Italian contemporary cuisine</strong>. A
                    lot of restaurants claim to merge tradition and innovation, few achieve it as seamlessly as this
                    chef and his team.

                <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Au Revoir</h4>
                <p>After our final lunch together, we’ll wrap up around 16:30, bringing our Paris Adventure to an end.
                </p>
                <p>We will say goodbye and maybe shot one last picture together.</p>
                <p>Whether you choose to linger a bit longer in the city — perhaps with one last espresso or a stroll
                    through the streets — or head straight back to Zurich…</p>
                <p class="font-semibold">I hope Paris stays with you, not just as a place you visited, but as an
                    unforgettable foodie adventure.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center font-serif text-3xl">The words of someone who was with me in Paris...</h2>

            <div class="mt-4 bg-amber-100 rounded-lg p-4 space-y-3">
                <p>Ehm, what is that?</p>
                <p> When I first heard about this so-called "<em>Bistrot Tour</em>" in Paris, I was skeptical, to say the
                    least.</p>
                <p>Why would I spend a whole weekend hopping from one tiny, noisy restaurant to another?</p>
                <p>French bistros aren’t they just overpriced tourist traps serving the same old croque-monsieur? </p>

                <p>The first day, we started with a more traditional restaurant theme.</p>
                <p> Imagine this, small restaurant, tiny old wooden tables, people speaking only French…</p>
                <p>I expected nothing special, but then came the first bite: a perfectly cooked lamb with a sauce so rich
                    and complex. </p>
                <p>The place was packed, the waiters attentive and efficient, the atmosphere full with real Parisians, not a
                    single turist in sight.</p>
                <p>And the waiters and their service was top-notch.</p>
                <p>But what really blew my mind was the desert. </p>
                <p>You know how you always get this tiramisu or some industrial style cake with some ice cream on the side.
                </p>
                <p class="font-bold">Well, what I got was incredible. </p>
                <p>It was pistachio cream, crème fresh with a sauce of roses and all this topped with crunchy nuts. I can
                    tell you, my senses were amazed for the rest of the day. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Day two: "Neo-Bistrot."</p>
                <p>As a lover of traditional cuisine, I didn’t know what to expect, and I was not really understanding the
                    difference between Bistrots, but when you taste it, you completely understand the difference between the
                    styles. </p>
                <p class="font-bold">This was not pretentious; this was innovation.</p>
                <p>A beef steak paired with a beetroot purée and Korean kimchi that somehow made perfect sense.</p>
                <p> And the bread! </p>
                <p>The kind of crust that makes a grown man reconsider his entire approach to breakfast. Can you imagine
                    falling in love with a simple slice of bread?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>By the third day, we visited the “Hidden Gem”. I had already accepted my fate. </p>
                <p>Bring it on, I thought. And they did. A hidden gem in an alley I would have never dared enter on my own.
                </p>
                <p>An old factory reconverted to a luxury fine dining restaurant.</p>
                <p>We tasted 7 dishes in a perfectly paced lunch, from fresh asparagus smoked in the wood-fired oven of the
                    restaurant, to a “crepe” with sea-hurchins and roasted pidgeon.</p>
                <p>I would have never thought that a street rat could taste so good.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I could talk for hours how amazing Paris is.</p>
                <p> I will definitely come back and see what they offer in the autumn.</p>
                <p class="font-bold">This tour? Absolutely worth it. </p>
                <p> If you, like me, think you have seen it all, trust me, you haven’t.</p>
                <p>Book the trip. Eat the food. And prepare to be amazed.</p>
