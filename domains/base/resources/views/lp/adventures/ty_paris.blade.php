            <p class=" text-center"> <strong>Completely free</strong> and <strong>Not Binding</strong></p>
            <p>Iâ€™m preparing a beautiful booklet for you: filled with all the information, inspiring photos, and the full program of our trip. </p>

            <div class="lg:my-4">
                <x-forms::address.new backUrl="/ty/paris/final" />
            </div>
            <p><strong>When it is ready</strong>, you will receive it directly in your letterbox and a special
                bonus :), nothing will be charged. </p>

            <div class="space-y-3 mt-1">
                <h2 class="h2">Why for free?</h2>
                <p>I know that today everything happens through a screen: Instagram, Linkedin, etc...</p>
                <p>One of the reasons I organize these trips is to create a <strong>real escape</strong>: to bring you out
                    of Zurich, away from the routine, away from work emails buzzing in your pocket.</p>
                <p>Just you, your passions, amazing foods and drinks and a weekend that feels like a breath of fresh air.
                </p>
                <p>For the same reason, I will personally print the entire program and send it to you, at my own expenses.
                </p>
                <p>Because I believe in real experiences. Because I want you to feel, even before the trip begins, how much
                    care and love I put into <strong>crafting every detail</strong>.</p>
                <p class="text-right">Marco</p>

                <p class="mt-2"> <strong>P.S.</strong> If you are not interested, just ignore this, you will still receive
                    the invitation but only via email.</p>
